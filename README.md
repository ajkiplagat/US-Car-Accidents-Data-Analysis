# US-Car-Accidents-Data-Analysis
This project is an analysis of US car accidents data from 2016-2020
- Data Description: Data used is from Kaggle and is of car accident data collected from February 2016 to June 2020 using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within road-networks. There are about 3.5 million accident records in the dataset, covering 49 States of the USA.
